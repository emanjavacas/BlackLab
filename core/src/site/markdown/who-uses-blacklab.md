# Who is using BlackLab?

-   The Institute of Dutch Lexicology ([INL](http://www.inl.nl/)) is developing BlackLab and uses it for their corpus search applications, such as [Letters as loot](http://brievenalsbuit.inl.nl/), [Corpus Gysseling](http://gysseling.corpus.taalbanknederlands.inl.nl/) and the [Corpus Hedendaags Nederlands](http://chn.inl.nl/) (CLARIN login required), a 500M+ token corpus of contemporary Dutch.
